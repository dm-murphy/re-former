[Forms Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms) in The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum.

This exercise first creates a form with HTML, then revises the form with Rails' form_tag helper and finally uses the new form_with helper. 

Users can be created and edited. The form will display errors messages for failed validations.
